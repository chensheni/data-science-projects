This script provides a structured attempt for implementing A/B testing in game development. It begins with an overview of A/B testing knowledge, highlighting the core questions developers seek to answer, such as t-statistic, p-value, and comprehensive decision making. The script then covers practical steps for setting up A/B tests, including creating test groups, data exploration, minimum sample size calculation, t-test (assumptions verification and test implementation) and effect size.
